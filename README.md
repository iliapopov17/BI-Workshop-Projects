## Project 5. "H+"

For [Project 5](Project%205) we performed genotyping and SNP annotation of human 23andMe project data.

## Project 4. Eukaryotic genomes: Tardigrades

For [Project 4](Project%204) we performed tardigrade Ramazzottius varieornatus genome annotation and protein function prediction.

## Project 3. De novo sequencing. E.coli outbreak investigation

For [Project 3](Project%203) we did de novo assembly of its genome.

## Project 2. Deep Sequencing

For [Project 2](Project%202) we did bla-bla-bla.

## Project 1. Alignment to reference, variant calling

For [Project 1](Project%201) we did variant calling of Escherichia coli WGS. During the project we did data preprocessing with `FastQC` and `Trimmomatic`, then we mapped trimmed reads to a large reference genome with `bwa`, generated `mpileup` file using `samtools` and performed variant calling with `VarScan`
